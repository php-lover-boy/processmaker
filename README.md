(I uploaded sample file named: sample.json)

2.Send this file to process admin user and request to import thie file as a process.

3. when admin user import this file and try to archive this process, the malicious javascript code will be executed. 

(chrome latest version: Version 126.0.6478.127 (Official Build) (64-bit))

It is obvius that in import function there is lack of user input sanitization. 

# Maliciuos file upload 
1. admin user can upload html file and bypass image restrication in Customize UI, custom login logo upload section.
